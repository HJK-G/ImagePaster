# ImagePaster
This is a Google Chrome extension that creates an image url for any image you need to paste into the browser

Uses Imgur API to host the images and retrieve the urls.


To install:
1. Download this repository as a zip file
2. Unpack the zip file
3. Go to chrome://extensions/ on Google Chrome and enable developer mode
4. Press load unpacked
5. Select this repository (the main folder that came in the zip file)
6. The extension should now show up in your extensions list, and you can pin it for easier access if necessary


Eventually, I will attempt to post this to the Chrome Web Store, so you may see it there.
